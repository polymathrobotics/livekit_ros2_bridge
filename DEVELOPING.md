# Developing

`livekit_ros2_bridge` is a standard ROS 2 package. After sourcing the target ROS 2 environment and
workspace, use normal `colcon` commands from the workspace root:

```bash
colcon build --packages-up-to livekit_ros2_bridge
colcon test --packages-select livekit_ros2_bridge
colcon test-result --verbose
```

The build infers the LiveKit SDK artifact from `ROS_DISTRO` when `LIVEKIT_SDK_DISTRO` is unset, so
make sure the sourced environment matches the distro you intend to build.

## Formatting and linting

Formatting and linting come from the shared
[Polymath code standard](https://github.com/polymathrobotics/polymath_code_standard) pre-commit
hooks, which bundle their own clang-format, cpplint, cmakelint, yamlfix, and pymarkdown settings.
Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com), for example with
[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), then enable the hooks in your clone:

```bash
uv tool install --with pre-commit-uv pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

To check the whole tree rather than only staged files, run `pre-commit run --all-files`.

Commits that only reformat code are listed in `.git-blame-ignore-revs`. GitHub skips them in its
blame view; to do the same locally, run `git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs`.
