# Developing

`livekit_ros2_bridge` is a standard ROS 2 package. After sourcing the target ROS 2 environment and
workspace, use normal `colcon` commands from the workspace root:

```bash
colcon build --packages-up-to livekit_ros2_bridge
colcon test --packages-select livekit_ros2_bridge
colcon test-result --verbose
```

The build infers the LiveKit SDK artifact from `ROS_DISTRO` when `LIVEKIT_SDK_DISTRO` is unset, so
make sure the sourced environment matches the distro you intend to build.
